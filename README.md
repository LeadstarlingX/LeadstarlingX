# Hi there, I'm Saad Aswad 👋

I'm a final-year Software Engineering student at the Higher Institute for Applied Science and Technology (HIAST). I am deeply passionate about backend development and am on a mission to build clean, high-quality, and sustainable applications with .NET.

My philosophy is that great software is built on a foundation of solid design and rigorous testing. I am driven by the pursuit of creating innovative solutions for the modern web.

### 🌱 What I'm Focusing On

I am building my expertise in the essential areas of modern backend development to create professional, production-ready applications.

* **🧱 Architectures & Design Patterns:** Applying patterns like **Clean Architecture** to create scalable, maintainable, and loosely-coupled systems.
* **✍️ RESTful API Design:** Focusing on creating well-structured and intuitive APIs based on **RESTful design principles**.
* **🧪 Comprehensive Testing:** I believe testing is crucial for reliability. I practice **Unit Testing** and **Integration Testing** to ensure my code is robust and works as expected before deployment.
* **💻 Backend with .NET:** Mastering the construction of powerful APIs with **ASP.NET Core** and managing data efficiently with **Entity Framework Core**.
* **🛡️ Upcoming: Security:** My next learning goal is to dive into application security, focusing on implementing proper authentication and authorization.

While my current passion is the backend, I am excited about the possibility of growing into a full-stack developer in the future.
