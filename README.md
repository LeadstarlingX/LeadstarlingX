# Hi there, I'm Saad Aswad 👋

I'm a final-year Software Engineering student at HIAST, specializing in the design of high-integrity backend systems. My journey has evolved from mastering implementation to architecting solutions that prioritize sustainability, clean design, and production-grade reliability.

My philosophy is that professional software is defined by its architectural rigor and constant validation. I am driven by the challenge of building complex, observable systems that stand up to the demands of the modern web.rn web.

### 🌱 What I'm Focusing On

I have sharpened my focus on the essential pillars of enterprise backend development to create systems that are truly production-ready.

* **🏛️ Architectural Excellence: Applying Clean Architecture, DDD, and CQRS to build scalable, loosely-coupled systems that manage business complexity gracefully.
* **📊 Observability & Metrics: Leveraging OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, and Grafana to move beyond simple logging into proactive system instrumentation and monitoring.
* **🛡️ Security & IAM: Implementing robust authentication and authorization flows using Keycloak and modern OAuth2/OIDC standards.
* **🧪 High-Fidelity Testing: Ensuring total reliability through advanced Integration Testing (Testcontainers) and Architecture Testing to validate system boundaries.
* **⚡ Core .NET Mastering: Building high-performance services with .NET 9, focusing on efficiency, concurrency, and clean data access with EF Core.
* 
While I am currently mastering the depth of the backend, I am strategically expanding my skills toward becoming a highly proficient full-stack developer.
